## ✨ About This Project

This portfolio website serves as my personal branding platform, containing:

- Professional profile & introduction  
- Organizational and internship experience  
- List of technical & soft skills  
- Selected web projects  
- Contact & social media links  

The main goal of this project is to present myself not only as a **coder**, but also as a **team leader and adaptable learner**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic structure  
- **CSS3** — custom styling & responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — interactive behavior  
- **Font Awesome** — icons  
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)**  

No framework, no library — built with **pure fundamentals**.

> ⚠️ *Intentional choice:*  
> This project is made without frameworks to strengthen my understanding of **basic web fundamentals**, not because I can’t use frameworks.
